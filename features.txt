## How It Works (Simple)

1. **Login** → Users sign in with email/password
2. **Create Project** → Add new construction project with details
3. **Upload Model** → Upload IFC file or connect Autodesk/Speckle model
4. **Create Schedule** → Add tasks manually or import from MS Project
5. **Link Elements** → Connect tasks to 3D model elements
6. **4D Simulation** → Play timeline to see construction progress in 3D
7. **Monitor Progress** → Track task completion and schedule health
8. **Team Collaboration** → Assign tasks, add comments, share updates
9. **AI Assistance** → Get smart suggestions for tasks and optimization
10. **Export/Report** → Generate reports and export data
